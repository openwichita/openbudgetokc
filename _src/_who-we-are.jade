h2.subheader Who we are
p
  | Open Budget: Wichita is the result of many  
  a(href="https://github.com/openwichita/openbudgetwichita/graphs/contributors") contributors 
  | including coders, community advocates, and city officials. We're looking for ideas and help, so get in touch and join in at our regular
  | meetups.  We have in-person meetings (please check 
  a(href='https://www.meetup.com/openwichita/' target='_blank') meetup.com 
  | for location and time)
  | and on-line virtual meetings on 
  a(href='http://openwichita.com/slack' target='_blank') Slack
  |.

h2.subheader How would you use this tool?
p
  | We're trying to build a tool that's useful to all of Wichita â€” community advocates, journalists, city officials, and the people they serve.
  | The project idea originated in Oakland, CA as 
  a(href="https://github.com/openoakland/openbudgetoakland") Open Budget Oakland. 
  | Then it was forked by 
  a(href="https://github.com/codeforokc/openbudgetokc") Open Budget Oklohoma City, 
  | a project under 
  a(href="http://codeforokc.org/") Code for OKC 
  | from which our project was in turn forked.
