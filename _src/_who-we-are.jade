h2.subheader How would you use Open Budget: Wichita?
p
| We're trying to build a tool that's useful to all of Wichita â€” community advocates, journalists, city officials, and the people they serve.
br
br
| The project idea originated in Oakland, CA as 
a(href="https://github.com/openoakland/openbudgetoakland") Open Budget Oakland. 
| Then it was forked by 
a(href="https://github.com/codeforokc/openbudgetokc") Open Budget Oklohoma City, 
| a project under 
a(href="https://http://codeforokc.org/") Code for OKC 
| from which our project was in turn forked.


br
h2.subheader
| We want your ideas!
br
p
br
| What part of the budget should be visualized, and how?
br
| What budget data should be accessible, and why?
br
| Who should be part of this discussion?
