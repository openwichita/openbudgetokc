ul.disc
  li
    | We work with 
    strong community groups 
    | to learn what aspect of the budget is most relevant to them, and how it would be best shared with the public.
  li
    | We work with 
    strong Wichita Budget Office
    |  to access budget data and present it in a simple, useful format.
  li
    | We 
    strong visualize
    |  Wichita's budget data, and 
    strong share resources
    |  for people to create their own visualizations and analyses.
  li
    | We use tools that are 
    strong free, open-source, and require minimum technical skill
    |.
  li
    | We 
    strong stimulate dialogue and provide a forum
    |  for the Wichita community to discuss the budget.
